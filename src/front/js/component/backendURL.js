		<h2>Missing BACKEND_URL env variable</h2>
		<p>Here's a video tutorial on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/16498567?key=72dbf905fe4fa6d3224783d02a8b1b9c">how to update your backend URL environment variable.</a></p>
		<p>There's a file called <Dark>.env</Dark> that contains the environmental variables for your project.</p>
		<p>There's one variable called <Dark>BACKEND_URL</Dark> that needs to be manually set by yourself.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure you backend is running on port 3001.</li>
			<li>Open your API and copy the API host.</li>
			<li>Open the .env file (do not open the .env.example)</li>
			<li>Add a new variable BACKEND_URL=<Dark>your api host</Dark></li>
			<li>Replace <Dark>your api host</Dark> with the public API URL of your flask backend sever running at port 3001</li>
